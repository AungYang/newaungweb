                    Diabetes Design Initiative (DDI) from <span class="highlight">UC San Diego Design Lab</span>
                    collaborated with <span class="highlight">Dexcom</span> in order to solve issues that customers face
                    using the Dexcom G6
                    Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Three common problems users deal with are wearable issues, understanding accuracy,
                    and signal loss. We were broken up into smaller teams and our focus was proposing a solution for
                    dealing with <u>signal loss</u>.
                    We went through the phases of human-centered iterative design process (observing, ideating,
                    prototyping, testing) through
                    the 7-week sprints. Due to NDA, I am not allowed to show the prototypes.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3><i>"Why are these issues worth mentioning?"</i></h3>
                <p>
                    By redesigning the G6 app, we accomplish the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Empower patients</span> → We allow users to self-diagnose the problem
                        before calling Dexcom</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Reduce customer support calls</span> → Phone calls are expensive (time)
                        for both Dexcom staff and consumers</li>

                </ul>
                </p>

                Our first step is discussing <b>solution concepts</b> so that we can describe the
                problem and potential solutions. The process of drawing storyboard helps depict a user's
                experience with a product and why these issues are worth solving.
                I jumped on reddit to do research and drew my storyboard
                on a customer who lost signal due to software incompatibility. In my drawing, I
                made sure to express the emotional distress a diabetic patient may feel as their G6 app
                fails to be responsive.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Problem Statement:</b> Users undergo a tremendous amount of stress whenever their G6 app stops giving
                them
                data because they no longer know how many insulin units to inject to decrease blood sugar levels.
                Although 70%
                of all signal losses are restored in less than 35 minutes, many users will be tempted to call Dexcom
                anyways.

            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Initial Proposed Solution: </b> First implement an automated timer that counts down as soon as
                a signal loss has been detected so the user is informed on how much longer to wait. Secondly, include
                an interactive chatbot that uses keywords to respond to users and guides them through the
                troubleshooting steps.

            <br>
            <p>
                After deciding to implement an automated countdown timer along with an interactive chatbox,
                we began making our <b>visual prototypes </b> by using colored paper and pen. 

                We tested our prototype with 4 people (mix of Dexcom users and DDI leaders) and received their feedback
                on the design.
                Some of the comments I wrote down were
            <ul>
                <li>"'check it' button is weird; makes more sense to have a 'next' button"</li>
                <li>"yes/no labels are confusing"</li>
                <li> "this particular illustration could be interpreted as clickable affordances"</li>
            </ul>

            We used the results from this iteration to refine our upcoming prototype to have a better UI/UX design.

                Our idea of a chatbot was discontinued because of its complexity, but we still retained the
                "interactive" aspect of it. This is the phase where we began building our <b>interactive prototype</b> by using web-based tools. 
                The premise of the interactive checklist is to have users go through a list of troubleshooting steps of 
                methods known to resolve signal loss; these consist of <u>checking range, checking bluetooth, and checking for physical blockage.</u>
                Our next iterations in the development cycle involves testing with numerous people from other teams and DDI leaders.
                For the next few weeks, we repeated the same rapid prototyping cycle to <b><i>get feedback → redesign interface →
                        conduct user testing. </i></b> 
              
            </p>

            <p>
                I noticed a pattern when I took notes on users testing our prototype: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Certain elements afford the wrong actions (swiping on non-interactive elements)</li>
                    <li>Bolding and enlarging text elements helps reinforce importance and presence</li>
                    <li>Rewording certain words to convey the right idea as succintly as possible</li>
                </ul>
                Additionally, we received feedback that our automated timer in number format was confusing for older people who aren't
                tech-savvy. Based on this data, we modified the timer from numbers to a visual representation of a countdown. 
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In week 6 of our sprints, we did usability testing on our latest prototype by using the System Usablility
                Scale (SUS), a cheap & valid way of evaluating the usability of a website.
            
                We had 6 Dexcom users answer the 10 template questions after running through our prototype. We
                summarized our findings and punched out the SUS of our prototype to be ~75, which is above average (68).
