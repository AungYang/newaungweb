                                At UCSD Design Lab, we worked in collaboration with Dexcom to improve
                                user experience for users using the Dexcom G6 CGM app. Users experience 3 key issues: <b>signal loss, wearable issue, & accuracy. </b>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Our team focused on <u>signal loss</u>. Our first task was to draw storyboards; I drew my storyboard on a Redditor who lost signal due to software
                                incompatibility. Our solution was implementing an interactive checklist that checks off the troubleshooting steps that are the
                                most common solutions for signal loss. We conducted numerous user interviews and iteratively improved our Figma prototypes based on
                                data from user testing. We also used scripts and calculuated System Usablility Scale (SUS) scores. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In the end, each team integrated their respective solutions into one: The Resolution Center, which handles and resolves the 3
                                major issues. 
                            </p>
